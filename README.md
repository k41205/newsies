## Description

It's a full-stack app created in a week for an interview. This project was my leap from front-end to full-stack development, combining Node.js, Express, MongoDB (with Mongoose), JavaScript, and Sass. Despite applying as a front-end developer, I embraced the challenge of building Newsies as a full-stack endeavor - a humorous twist that accelerated my learning curve and broadened my technical repertoire.

Even if it doesn't adhere to industrial standards and looks like a badly written app, I left this project here as a testimonial of my journey as a full-stack developer. You can look at my latest projects to see how my approach has changed during this time.
