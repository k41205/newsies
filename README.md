## Description

It's a full-stack app realized in a week for an interview purpose. The tech stack here is Node.js and Express as back end, MongoDB as DB with Mongoose library and pure JS and Sass as front end (I didn't know any front-end library like React yet).

You can give a look at it here:

Front end hosted on Netlify with automated CI/CD:
