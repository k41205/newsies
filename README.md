## Description

It's a full-stack app created in a week for an interview. This project was my leap from front-end to full-stack development, combining Node.js, Express, MongoDB (with Mongoose), JavaScript, and Sass. Despite applying as a front-end developer, I embraced the challenge of building Newsies as a full-stack endeavor - a humorous twist that accelerated my learning curve and broadened my technical repertoire.

Even if it doesn't adhere to industrial standards and looks like a badly written app, I left this project here as a testimonial of my journey as a full-stack developer. You can look at my latest projects to see how my approach has changed during this time.

It was hosted on Heroku free plan but it doesn't exist anymore. Now backend is hosted on Render free plan, so it needs about 50 seconds for the server to provide a response when in sleepy mode.

You can give a look at it here:
